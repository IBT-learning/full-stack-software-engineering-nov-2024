    <h1>Mambilla Plateau</h1>
    <h3 class="heading1">Tales About the untapped "goldmine" in Nigeria</h3>
    <div class="first-content">
    <p>
        The Mambilla Plateau is a high grassland plateau with an average elevation of about 1,524 metres (5,000 ft) above sea level, making it the highest plateau in Nigeria.<br>
            
        The plateau which has an undulating landscape free of insects, also has temperate climate within a tropical region.
        It houses the <a href="https://image.api.sportal365.com/process/smp-images-production/pulse.ng/19112024/3adebbbd-35fa-41f2-94b1-747e92e8de93">Chappal Waddi mountain</a> considered as the highest point in Nigeria and probably in West Africa with an average height of about 2,419 metres (7,936 ft) above sea level.<br>
        As soon as one reaches the top of the mountain, the hot weather witnessed at the foot of the mountain disappears and you will be greeted by fresh and very chilled breeze blowing across the plateau.
        Situated in Sardauna Local Government Area of Taraba State, The Mambilla Plateau can be described as a goldmine, which remains largely untapped.
        <h3>Beauty of the plateau</h3>
        From the lush vegetation that is reflected in the large trunk of fruit trees and cash crops produced to the endless natural resources, 
        The Plateau and its inhabitants however have little or nothing to show for this seeming abundance in natural resources for decades.<br>
           
        The journey to Mambilla starts on a snake-like road from the foot of the mountain to the top, about 25 to 30 minutes drive where you start savouring the beauty of the plateau.<br>
        There are rolling hills, backdropped with exotic flora and fauna. It has a lot of scenic views to behold, which while watching the mountain chain and the curvacious valleys you will have a breath of fresh air that is uncommon in many other parts of Nigeria.
