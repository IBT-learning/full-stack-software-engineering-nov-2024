## Eudorah's diverse Music taste
![spotify](spotify)  
As an introvert, music is an integral part of my life. It is one thing that has single-handedly carried me throughout each stage of my life. I breathe and live music. sadly, i cannot sing to save myself. Trust me, my neigbours that hear my off-key tone deaf singing every blessed day can attest to that. Well, atleast they listen to quality music not the jusin beiber playlist 13 year old me would have had on repeat. Although i didnt get a spotify wrapped for 2024 (which i'll forever hold a grudge for), here are my top songs artists for 2024.
### 1. Summertime Sadness
Although realeased in 2012, i discovered summertime sadness this year. [summertime sadness](https://open.spotify.com/track/3BJe4B8zGnqEdQPMvfVjuS?si=971d86b51cc544e6) explores the atmosphere of a bittersweet summertime where Lana danced, cruised and felt electrified with a loved one. I adore her voice and the deep meanings behind the lyrics.
### 2. Digii
[Digii](https://open.spotify.com/track/3l9lLHiznAYqX0mOoauBvA?si=99c3004a3b1c433b) by Mr.Tee, Chacha and Tenorboy had me hooked for months. The catchy track, showcases both performers’ distinctive vocal skills and captivating presence that just kept me hitting repeat even though i had no idea what the lyrics meant.
### 3. The Conflict of The Mind 
Who dosent love Aurora? Definetly not me because three of her mysic made it to my best playlist for 2024. ["The Conflict of The Mind"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5lxZ3KmRdRn6iW5tE1Fwjp?si=bba25eefece04d73) made me realise that It’s truly when we open up We find the purest proof of love hidden in the conflict of our minds.
### 4. Agora Hills
The Tiktok influencer Prayag had me hooked to agora hills like a drug addict. [Agora Hills](https://open.spotify.com/track/7dJYggqjKo71KI9sLzqCs8?si=7b6f1040616346e3) by Doja Cat evokes the complex feelings of wanting to publicize a love that must be kept private out of necessity. 
### 5.I Wanna Be Yours
Reworking a poem into a song is extremely difficult but artic monkeys made that possible and i fell completely head over heels with this song. My romantic self loves the chorus ["I Wanna Be Yours"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5XeFesFbtLpXzIVDNQP22n?si=0898c18c95c24b8e).

Other songs that pulled at my heartstrings include;
