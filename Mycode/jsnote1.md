# JavaScript Assignment #1: Strings and Numbers
In this assignment you will perform some basic operations and `console.log()` the results.
Create a new file inside your code folder for this assignment. You will run your code using `node <your-file-path>.js`. Remember that the path to your file is always relative to your working directory!
You may do these challenges all together in one file, or in separate files, according to your preference. You will turn them in all together.
### Strings
-   Create a constant variable and assign it a _string literal_ with your name
-   Console log the _length_ of the string
-   Console log the _string template_ "Hello, my name is \_\_\_\_" but fill in the blank with the name variable.
-   Console log the _string template_ "When my friends see me they shout \_\_\_\_!" but fill in the blank with your name in all caps. (Use a string method to capitalize it!)
### Numbers
#### Challenge 1:
-   Create a constant variable with a number in it. (You can choose any number, with any number of digits.)
-   Multiply the number by 2
-   Add 8
-   Divide by 2
-   Subtract the original number
-   Console log the result
-   The result should be 4
Tips:
-   You can use any number of variables to do this, but you only need one or two!
-   If you choose to combine operations within a single line, don't forget about mathematical order of operations
#### Challenge 2:
-   Find the area of a circle with a given radius (), rounded to four digits
-   Console log the result
Tips:
-   A radius of 2 should give you 12.5664, and a radius of 3 should give you 28.2743
-   Don't forget about order of operations!
-   When you are ready to submit, make a pull request following the steps in our [Git Steps](../../../git-steps.md) document.

# JavaScript Data Types
## Primitive types
A primitive type stores a single value. It is not an object, and has no properties or methods. There are exactly 7 primitive types:
-   string
-   number (including NaN)
-   boolean
-   null
-   undefined
-   bigint (we'll never use these)
-   symbol (we'll never use these)
Though each data point has no properties or methods, the type itself has properties and methods which we can use to read or manipulate the data.
## Reference types
Reference types store references to collections of data, rather than single data points.
There are a basically unlimited number of reference types, which are all, under the hood, different implementations of a JS object. The reference types we are most likely to see and use are:
-   object
-   array
-   function
-   map
-   set
-   (and more)

/* 
    VARIABLES
    * a variable represents one piece of data in memory
    * in JS variables must be declared
    * declaration
        * allows memory space to be reserved using an identifier
        * starts with keywords: let, const, or (archaic) var
        * variable names must start with a letter, $, or _
        * if no value is assigned, it's undefined
    * assignment
        * gives the variable a data value
        * can be any value or data type
        * can be reassigned (unless declared with const)
    * initialization
        * giving a new variable its first value
        * usually done on the same line as declaration
    
    Naming things is one of the two hard problems of computer science
    * what makes a good variable name?
        * JS variable names use camelCase
            * first letter lowercase
            * if there are multiple words
            * first letter of subsequent words are capitalized
        * names should describe either
            * the data the variable stores, or
            * the intended usage of that data
        * longer is better than shorter (but not longer than necessary)
    
    Side note on casing:
    Different case conventions are used in different situations
        * kebab-case (we use this in html and css)
        * camelCase (used for most things in JS)
        * WordCase or PascalCase (used for certain things in JS)
        * snake_case (used in Python)
        * SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE or CONSTANT_CASE (used in JS for constants)
