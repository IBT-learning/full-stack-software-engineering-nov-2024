We will use a lot of programs throughout this course. This is not all of them, but these are the ones we need to get started.

If you work on multiple computers, it will be possible to complete your coursework by synchronizing your work between computers. However, each computer will need to have all of these programs installed and configured.

It should not reference information such as your age or birth year, your location or place of birth, your education or employment history, or your family status. I personally prefer usernames _not_ to include words like "dev", "coder", "hacker", etc, but not everyone frowns upon those. It should be short, and written all lowercase. It can include numbers, hyphens `-` or underscores `_`, but it's better if it doesn't.
