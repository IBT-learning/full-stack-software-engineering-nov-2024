/*
Strings
Create a constant variable and assign it a string literal with your name
Console log the length of the string
Console log the string template "Hello, my name is ____" but fill in the blank with the name variable.
Console log the string template "When my friends see me they shout ____!" but fill in the blank with your name in all caps. (Use a string method to capitalize it!)
Numbers
Challenge 1:
Create a constant variable with a number in it. (You can choose any number, with any number of digits.)
Multiply the number by 2
Add 8
Divide by 2
Subtract the original number
Console log the result
The result should be 4
Tips:

You can use any number of variables to do this, but you only need one or two!
If you choose to combine operations within a single line, don't forget about mathematical order of operations
Challenge 2:
Find the area of a circle with a given radius (), rounded to four digits
Console log the result
Tips:

A radius of 2 should give you 12.5664, and a radius of 3 should give you 28.2743
Don't forget about order of operations!
