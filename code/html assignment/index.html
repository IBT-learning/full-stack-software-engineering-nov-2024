      <h2> New Yam Fastivial in Igbo Land</h2>
   <div class="description">

        <p>The New Yam Festival is a celebration of the yam harvest and the start of a new farming season in many parts of Nigeria</p>
      <p>The festival celebrates the importance of yams in Igbo culture and society, and is a time to give thanks to the earth goddess, Ani, and ancestors for the harvest.</p>
      <p>The festival includes rituals, feasting, and discarding old yams to symbolize renewal. In some communities, people eat all the old yams before the festival. The next day, only yam dishes are served at the feast. </p>
      <p>The festival includes a variety of activities, such as cultural dances, masquerade dances, fashion parades, and contemporary shows. The Igwe (King) or eldest man may perform rites. </p>
      <p>The festival can last a day, a week, or more, depending on the community. </p>
      <p>It is considered taboo to eat new yams before the festival. Doing so is thought to appease the gods and spirit of harvest, and ensure a better harvest in the new season. </p>
