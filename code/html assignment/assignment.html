    <p>Best time to visit the park
      Nairobi National Park is open all year round and can be visisted any time, but the dry season from June to September is generally the best time for wildlife watching, when animals can easily be seen around water sources. Wildlife watching is usually difficult during the raining season ( between March and May and October to November ). During these months, rainfall might restrict game drives and the grass tends to be very high.</p>
