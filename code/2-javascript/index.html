    <h1>Coding the game</h1>
    <div>
      You will complete this project in a JavaScript file that you will run in
      the browser, via an HTML file. Get input from the user using prompt() and
      send messages to the user using alert() You will need to use loops and
      conditionals to make this program work. Technically you could complete it
      without any functions, but I strongly recommend using functions to keep
      your code tidy and organized. Gameplay will work like this: ask the user
      to choose a number between 1 and 100 ask the user something like "is the
      number higher than, lower than, or exactly 50?" continue asking that
      question, but modify the number based on their previous answers when the
      user says you got the number right, end the game

      The best way to narrow down your guesses is by using the binary sort
      algorithm. This Khan Academy article explains the algorithm and gives a
      useful visualization. Tips to save the player (and you) from typing too
      much, offer the user the option to answer h (for higher), l (for lower),
      or c for correct off-by-one errors are a risk here. Double check the
      distinction betweens "greater than" and "greater than or equal to", and
      "less than" and "less than or equal to" sign reversal errors are also a
      common mistake. Make sure you're not using > when you should be using <,
      and vice versa when you feel like your game is close to ready, ask someone
      to play it. Watching them play is a great way to spot bugs, poor UX, and
      other issues with the program Extra challenges (optional) keep track of
      the number of guesses we needed, and display a message with that number at
      the end of the game handle invalid/unexpected inputs from the user when
      the game is over, ask the user if they want to play again, and if so play
      another round. (Hint: this requires a while loop.) write a version of the
      game in which the computer chooses the number, the user guesses numbers,
      and the computer answers whether the guess is higher or lower if you
      finish that and want more, make the program start by giving the user a
      choice between the two games, and then start the game they ask for ... and
      then ask again at the end of each round
