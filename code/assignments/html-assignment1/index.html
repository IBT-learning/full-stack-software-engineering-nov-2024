    <h3>Facts about Nigerian people and society</h3>
    <p>Now that you've had a taste of the culture of Nigeria, let us dive deeper into facts about Nigerian people and their society as a whole. There are many <a href="https://www.worldremit.com/en/blog/community/famous-nigerians-international-recognition" target="_blank">famous Nigerians who have received international recognition</a>. But you may also be curious about the <a href="http://https://www.worldremit.com/en/blog/community/nigerians-in-london" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> everyday migrants</a> who have made their way from Nigeria to places like London and other parts of the UK.
    
    
        No matter where you find Nigerians in the world, two aspects of  the culture ring true for almost everyone: their incredible sense of style and burning passion for football (soccer).</p>
    
    <h3> Nigerians have exquisite clothing style: Threads of culture</h3>
    <p>You may recognise a Nigerian by their clothing. The Ankara fabric, often called the ‘African print’, is one of the cheapest (but most unique) fabrics on the market today. It used to be made into traditional Iro (wrapper tied around the waist) and Buba (a long-sleeved blouse). But now, Ankara is also used for other fashionable items such as blazers, gowns, swimsuits and more.</p>
    <p>Below are samples of Ankara styles</p>

    <h3>Facts about Nigerian food</h3>
    <p>We’ve saved the most mouth-watering facts about Nigerian food for last. Like other West African cuisines, Nigerian food uses spices and herbs with palm or groundnut oil to create deeply flavoured sauces and soups.
    
    
        The country’s feasts can be both colourful and lavish, but it also does ‘low-key grub’ well too – you’ll find many roadside snacks cooked on the barbecue or fried in oil. You’ll find some local delicacies as well, as bushmeat is also consumed in Nigeria. That includes porcupine and cane rats! But you may be more keen to try the many tropical fruits that are found in abundance there, such as pineapple, coconut and mango.</p>
