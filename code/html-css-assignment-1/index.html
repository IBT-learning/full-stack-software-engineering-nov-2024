            <h2>My Bio</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>I am a 29-year-old passionate, God-loving individual, 
                deeply committed to my faith and the values I hold dear.
                 As a born-again Christian, I believe firmly in the power of 
                 God’s healing, miracles, signs, and wonders. My relationship 
                 with Jesus Christ is the foundation of my life, and I actively 
                 serve in my local assembly, where I find purpose and fulfillment
                  through service.
            </p>

            <h2>In Love and Anticipation</h2>
            <p>I am currently in a loving relationship with my girlfriend (Christabel),
                 and I’m filled with excitement as I plan to take the next big step in
                  our journey together. I am set to propose to her on March 9, 2025,
                   and I am hopeful, by God's grace, that we will be married by August 2025. 
                   I believe in God’s perfect timing, and I trust that our union will be
                    blessed and flourish.
