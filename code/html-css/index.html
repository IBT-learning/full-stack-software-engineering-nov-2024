        <h2>What is corrosion?</h2>
    </header>

    <section id="intro">
        <p>Corrosion is the natural process by which materials, usually metals, deteriorate as a result of chemical or electrochemical reactions with their environment. It is a common problem that occurs when materials are exposed to moisture, air, chemicals, or other environmental factors, causing them to lose their strength, appearance, or functionality over time.</p>

        <h2>How does Corrosion occur</h2>
        <p>Corrosion is often an electrochemical process involving the transfer of electrons. Here's how it typically happens:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Anodic Reaction (Oxidation): At a specific area on the metal's surface (called the anode), the metal atoms lose electrons and form positive metal ions.</li>
            <li>Cathodic Reaction (Reduction): At another area (called the cathode), the electrons released from the anode are consumed in a reduction reaction.</li>
            <li>Electrolyte: A conductive medium, such as water with dissolved salts or acids, facilitates the movement of ions between the anode and cathode.</li>
            <li>Corrosion Products: The reactions result in the formation of corrosion products, such as rust which weaken the material.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Corrosion</h2>
        <p>Corrosion can occur in various forms, depending on the material and environment:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Uniform Corrosion: Even degradation over the entire surface of the material.</li>

            <li>Galvanic Corrosion: Occurs when two different metals are in electrical contact in a corrosive environment.</li>

            <li>Pitting Corrosion: Localized corrosion that leads to small pits or holes on the surface.</li>

            <li>Crevice Corrosion: Happens in confined spaces where the environment becomes more aggressive.</li>
            <img src="Images/crevice.jpeg" alt="Image showing Crevice Corrosion" width="300" height="168">
            <li>Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC): Combination of stress and a corrosive environment leads to cracking.</li>

            <li>Intergranular Corrosion: Occurs along the grain boundaries of a metal.</li>

    <section id="factors">
        <h2>Factors Influencing Corrosion</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Material Composition: Different metals and alloys corrode at different rates.</li>
            <li>Environmental Conditions: High humidity, salt, and acidic environments accelerate corrosion.</li>
            <li>Protective Coatings: Paints, galvanization, or anodizing can slow down corrosion</li>
            <li>Presence of Impurities: Impurities in the metal or environment can influence corrosion rates.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    
    <section id="prevention-and-control">
        <h2>Prevention and Control</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Protective Coatings: Applying paint, oil, or other protective layers to isolate the material from the environment.</li>
            <li>Cathodic Protection: Using sacrificial anodes (less noble metals) to protect the main structure.</li>
            <li>Material Selection: Using corrosion-resistant materials like stainless steel or aluminum.</li>
            <li>Environmental Control: Reducing humidity, removing salts, or using inhibitors.</li>
            <li>Regular Maintenance: Cleaning and inspecting structures to identify and address early signs of corrosion.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Understanding and managing corrosion is crucial in industries like construction, transportation, and energy, where material integrity is critical.</p>
