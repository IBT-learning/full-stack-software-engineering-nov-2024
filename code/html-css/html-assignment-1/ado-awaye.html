        The natural world is a treasure trove of sights and wonders and something quite special, 
        can be found in western region of Oyo State, Nigeria. 
        Suspended lakes are amongst the most special wonders of nature because 
        they are large bodies of water that have pooled on a mountain or hill. 
        They are rare because of how difficult to reach most of them are, 
        so there are officially two accessible ones on the planet - here and in <a href="https://visitglenwood.com/hanginglake/" style="text-decoration: none;">Glenwood Springs</a> Colorado, US.
        
        
       
       <pre class="">The legend of the town's origins:</pre>
       
       <p>The Ado Awaye suspended lake is atop Oke Ado, a large hill in the mysterious town of Ado Awaiye. 
       The town's origins stretch back to the 1500's and the tales are full of interesting twist and turns. 
       Ado Awaye was was founded when a prince of the Oyo kingdom was denied his right to the throne 
       because of his "impure" blood. His mother was from Ota, and his brother was crowned in his stead. 
       He left in annoyance for his mother's hometown and on the way he encountered people in the Ado community. 
       They were escapees from the Dahomey war and they made him their king after learning of his heritage. 
       They would later amalgamate with the neighboring town of Awaiye, and that's how we have Ado-Awaiye today. 
       This hill we would be climbing was a refuge that an entire civilization grew from, and we were excited to see 
       and hear the whispers from those that inhabited these lands centuries ago.</p>

       <pre class="">The hike:</pre>

             <p>It's a short and steep climb, and after having spent the previous days on similar hikes, 
                we were quite burnt out. It took us about 25 minutes to climb 365 ancient stairs, but you get a hiking stick 
                that makes it easier. We visited during the wet season so the vegetation had grown thick - making it difficult 
                to navigate, but we hacked through with the sticks. The site could definitely use some maintenance to keep the 
                trail in good shape and make the climb safer. 
                The forest canopy was thick as well, a fantastic habitat for the population of monkeys that reside on the hill. 
                They had dropped hundreds of fruit seeds around us we were informed that these were a prime target for hunters 
                in the area - we have an unhealthy obsession with bushmeat.
                About halfway up, we came across the first attraction - the Ishage Rock, a large boulder delicately balanced on 
                the hill face in the most mystical manner. The people believe the rock to contain great power and many people 
                come here to make wishes. When these are granted, they return to the rock and tie a white cloth around it in thanks. 
                The rock is also a rain maker, and during times of drought, priestesses pray to Oke Ishage for rainfall for their f
                arms and families. We took a short break and I said a little prayer before we trudged along.</p>
