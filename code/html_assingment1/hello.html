<h2>
    The Legend of Zayaa Shrine
</h2>
<p>
    Sheik Abdul-Karim was a Mossi man who migrated to Wulugu from the Bawku area.<br> He claims to have had a dream in which the design of this building was revealed to him.<br>
When he went to the site from his dream, he found a well that he saw as a sign that Allah had provided water for its construction.<br> He built the structure directly above the well and designed it so that water could be accessed from from each level – even the upper room!

As he built, he noticed that when he awoke each morning another level was miraculously added to that which he had built the previous day. This continued day after day until he completed the massive, symmetrical, four-story mud building.

    He then had another dream in which he was told that the site was to be considered holy ground. For that reason, everyone must remove their shoes before entering.

    Additionally, there is a belief that the well contains sources water directly from Mecca’s holy <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamzam_Well">Zamzam Well</a>. This belief is very similar to that of the <a href="http://looklex.com/tunisia/kairouan09.htm">B’ir Barouta Well in Kairouan, Tunisia</a> . Many visitors to Zayaa collect this holy water from the well believing that it has the power to bring good luck and healing.
