            <h3>About the River Niger</h3>
            <p>The River Niger is primarily located in Nigeria.
                It is the longest river in West Africa and the second-longest in Africa, after the Nile.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, Nigeria got its name from the River Niger. Mrs. Flora Shaw Lugard, a British journalist and wife of the 
                first Governor-General of Nigeria, Lord Lugard, coined the name "Nigeria" 
                by combining the word "Niger" (from the river) and "area" to refer to the area around the river.</p>

            <h3>Formation of the Niger Delta</h3>
            <p>The Niger Delta is formed as a result of the inflow of the River Niger into the Atlantic Ocean. 
                The Niger Delta region is a vital region for Nigeria's economy due the abundance of oil and gas.</p>
