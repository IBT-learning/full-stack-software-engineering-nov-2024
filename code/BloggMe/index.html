          <p>About a year ago I increased the intensity of my weights. Going 4 times a week for the past year. No cardio at all. Only about 3-4 months ago I started taking nutrition seriously and started tracking everything and went into a slow cut at about 2200kcal. I have been hovering around 85kg for about 2 years by that time. In September-December 2024 I dropped to around 80kg. December interrupted the cut for obvious reasons. Continuing now to loose some more bf:</p>

          <p>Fullbody is great, it's a little hard to program correctly though. I'm doing upper/lower 4 times a week! Just keep improving and working on your weak points. You'll get there.</p>

          <p>Iâ€™d like to order my own weights at home and get back into working out / lifting.

            Would a pair of 20, 25, and 30 dumbbells be a good starting place? If not, what would be the best to start with? </p>
