   <h1>MUGUMO TREE</h1>
   <h2>Sacred Tree among the Kikuyu</h2>

   <p class="bracket-text">The Mugumo (Ficus Natalensis/ Ficus Thoningii) is an evergreen type of Fig whose wood is unsuitable for lumber or firewood and
    it does not need humans to grow. If the tree becomes bigger that it threatens to tip, a special sacrifice was made before young men were allowed to cut it dowm.
   </p>

<p> <hr>It was a Sanctuary where spiritual rituals were conducted and people brought food and gifts to Ngai "meaning God". It is often compared to 
    modern-day church buildings where people can go to pray and  invite Ngai, the owner and source of life to bless their families and communities
    with " peace, abundant food, fertile women, healthy chilren and cattle".</p>

    <P> <hr>A close study of the sacred Mugumo Tree reveals that taking care of the tree is tantamount to taking care of the environment and that when the 
        habitat is destroyed, plundered, or mismanaged the quality of life is undermined. It is also a symbol of fertiliy and succession, " Ituika" , the 
        passage of one ruling generation to another.</P> <hr>
