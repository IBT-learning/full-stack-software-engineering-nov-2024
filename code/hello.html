    <h1>Food in Nigeria</h1>
    <h2>3 Nigerian dishes that I like</h2>

    <div class="jellof">
      <h4>Jellof Rice</h4>
      <p>
        Nigerian food, like many cuisines in West Africa, is known for being
        spicy and aromatic. Jollof rice is perhaps the most famous Nigerian dish
        but the cuisine has so much more to offer, especially with its abundance
        of richly flavored soups and stews and equally plentiful “swallow”
        foods. Unfortunately, Nigerian food isn’t as well-known globally as
        other cuisines but thanks to the Nigerian diaspora, that may be
        changing. Nigerian recipe bloggers, many of whom have moved to different
        parts of the world, continue to champion Nigerian cuisine and help bring
        it into the global consciousness.

    <div class="egusi">
      <h4>Egwusi Soup</h4>
      <p>
        Egusi soup and fufu are two iconic dishes in Nigerian cuisine. The rich
        and flavorful egusi soup, made from ground melon seeds, is a staple in
        many Nigerian households. Fufu, on the other hand, is a soft and doughy
        accompaniment made from cassava or plantain flour. Together, they create
        a mouthwatering combination that is enjoyed by food lovers worldwide.

      <h4>Efo Riro (Spinach Soup)</h4>
     
      <p>
        Efo riro (or spinach soup) is a vegetable meal native to the Yoruba
        ethnic group of Western Nigeria and is prepared with ṣọ́kọ́ yòkòtò
        (Celosia argentea leaf), or ẹ̀fọ́ tẹ̀tẹ̀ (Amaranthus hybridus leaf). You may
        prepare both in the same way. The first step in preparing efo riro is to
        boil the leaves. Afterward, you fry the red oil and introduce pepper and
        other ingredients; the vegetable is often added towards the end of the
        cooking process. The taste of efo riro after the preparation depends on
        how well it’s cooked and how good the ingredients are. Efo riro’s main
        ingredients are fresh ground pepper, palm oil, onion, salt, seasoning,
        fish, meat, ponmo, stockfish, crayfish, and others.
