               If the automobile had followed the same development cycle as the computer,
               a Rolls-Royce would today cost $100, tet a million
               miles per gallon, and epxplode once a year, killing
               everyone inside. (Robert X. Xringely). For a long time it
               pzzled me hosw something so expensive, so leading edge, could be so useless.
               And then it occured to me that a computer is a stupid machine with the ability
               to do incredibly smart things, while computer programmers are 
               smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid things. They are,
               in short, a perfect match. (Bill Bryson) Java is, in many ways, C__-. (Michael Feldman)

                They have computers, adn they may have other weapons of mass
                destruction. (janet Reno) the cheapest, fastest and most 
                reliablee components are those that arent theren (Gordon
                bell) Everything that can be invernted has been invented.
                (charles H. Duell, Commisionner, U>S. Office of patents,
                1899) Firs,t, solve the problem. Then write the code. (John 
                Johnson)

                I've finaly learned what 'upward compatible' means. It
                means we get to keep all oour old mistaked. (Dennie van
                Tessel) It is not about bits, bytes and protocols, profits, 
                loosees and margins. (Lou Grestner) The best thingsabout a 
                boolean is even if you're wrn=ont, you areonly off by a bit. (Anonymous)

                i think there's a world market fo rabout 5 computers.
                (Thomas J. Watson, Chairman of the board, IBM, circa 1948)
                The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what
                a programmer is doing until its too late. (Seymour Cray)
                Complexity kills . it sucks the life out of developers, it 
                makes products diffficult to plan, build and test, it
                introduces security challenges, and it causes end-user nad
                administartor frustration. (Ray Ozzie) the only people who
                have anything to fear fro mfee software atre thosse whose
                products are worth even less. (David Emery)

                Uf McDonalds were run like a software company, one out of every hundred big macs would give you food poisonin, and the response would e 'We're sorry, here's a coupon for two more. (Mark Minasi)
                It has been said that the great scientific discipliiens are esxample of giants astanding ofn the shoulders of other gialnts. it has also bee said that the software aindlustry s nan example of midgests standing on the toes of oter hidgets. (Alan Cooper). 
                There are two ways ofconstructing a softwre design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, And the other way is to make it so complicated that there areno obvious deficiancies. (C.A.R. Hoare)
