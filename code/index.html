    <p id= para1> In 2011, over 500 million people worldwide voted for their top wonder of the natural world out of 28 finalists, and Table Mountain made the New 7 Natural Wonders of the World! 
        the flat plateau stretches 3 kilometres, and the highest point of Table Mountain stands at 1086 metres above sea level. The highest point is marked with a stone cairn that Thomas Maclear, 
        the Astronomer Royal at the Cape, had built in 1865 for use in a trigonometric survey. This spot is also known as Maclear’s Beacon and is about 19 metres higher than the cable station at the 
        western end of the plateau. The mountain, however, used to be three times this height, but has shrunk after millions of years of erosion.

    <p id="para2">What makes Table Mountain so special? Table Mountain gets its name from its flat top, which looks just like a table.
        The mountain, which is known by the Khoisan people as <i>"Hoerikwaggo", or "Mountain in the Sea", </i>has withstood millions of years of erosion and has, 
        as a result, become the richest floral kingdom in the world. 
        The Table Mountain National Park contains 1470 floral species and 8200 plant species, which is more than the entirety of Britain, with fynbos accounting for 80% of the plant life. 
        70% of the plants and animals found are endemic, meaning they can’t be found anywhere else in the world.</p>

    <p id="para3"> Interesting facts about Table Mountain in South Africa:</p>
    <ul class = four>

        <li>The only natural site in the world to have a constellation of stars named after it:
             ‘Mensa’, which translates to ‘table’ from Latin.</li>

        <li>The clouds that form over Table Mountain are known locally as the “table cloth.”
            This happens when southeasterly winds push moisture up the mountain's slopes into colder air. </li>
        
        <li>Over 800,000 people visit it each year.</li>
        
        <li>The cableway to the top of Table Mountain was built in 1929
            You can walk to the top of Table Mountain in under two hours. Or, you can always get the cable car </li>
        
        <li>Portuguese explorer António de Saldanha was the first European to climb Table Mountain in 1503. </li>
        
        <li>Scientists estimate that Table Mountain is around 360 million years old, 
            making it one of the oldest mountains in the world</li>
        
        <li>Table Mountain used to be home to a wide range of native wildlife, including lions, antelope, 
            leopards, and hyenas but sadly hunting wiped them out. In fact, accounts exist of early European 
            explorers being surrounded by what they thought were tigers and wolves.</li>
        
        <li>On any given day, you’re likely to spot snakes, lizards, dassies (big cuddly rodents), elands (a species of antelope), 
            tahrs (goat-like mammals), buzzards, tortoises, and porcupines.</li>

        <li>The most fascinating creature living on Table Mountain has to be the Table Mountain Ghost Frog. 
            This rare and endangered amphibian was first found in a dark, eerie, and inhospitable corner of Table Mountain called Skeleton Gorge, 
            hence the name Ghost Frog.</li>
