                <p>Doro Wot is a beloved Ethiopian dish often considered the heart of traditional celebrations and feasts. This rich and flavorful chicken stew is made with tender chicken drumsticks or thighs, slow-cooked in a vibrant, spiced sauce of onions, garlic, ginger, and the iconic berbere spice blend. The stew's deep red hue and complex taste come from the generous use of nitir kibe (spiced clarified butter) and a slow caramelization process. Served with hard-boiled eggs nestled in the sauce, Doro Wot is typically enjoyed with injera, Ethiopia's tangy flatbread, making it a meal that embodies warmth, tradition, and togetherness.</p>
