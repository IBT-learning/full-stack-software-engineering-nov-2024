        <em>
          The Olojo Festival is an ancient festival celebrated annually in Ife,
          Osun State, Nigeria.[1] It is one of the popular festivals in the
          Yoruba land, and was once described by Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi as
          a festival that celebrates the Black race all over the world.[2] The
          Yoruba word 'Olojo' means 'The Day Of The First Dawn' that describes
          the grateful heart of man towards God's creation and the existence of
          Human.[3] [4] The Olojo Festival is a culture festival in the calendar
          of the Ile-Ife, Osun State which is located in the Southwestern part
          of Nigeria.[5][6] It is the celebration of the remembrance of “Ogun”,
          god of Iron, who is believed to be the first son of Oduduwa,
          progenitor of the Yoruba people.[7] The festival is held annually in
          October.[8] It is one of the biggest festival on the culture calendar
          of lle-Ife
