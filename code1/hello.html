        Histories of world nations are not always documented in writings,
        sometimes, history lay bare in buildings for the senses to feel and the
        eyes to soak in their unique and beautiful sights. Nigeria, a nation
        indisputably rich in culture, has no shortage of such historical
        buildings in Nigeria and landmarks. Some of these buildings have a
        colonial touch, while others were built in pre-colonial times. Here is a
        look at five historic buildings in Nigeria that are significant for
        different reasons and worth knowing about.

          <br />
          <p>
            Built in the late 19th century, the Mary Slessor building is one of
            the monuments in memory of Mary Mitchell Slessor (2 December 1848–13
            January 1915), who was a Scottish missionary sent by the United
            Presbyterian Church to Nigeria. This modest-looking building, with
            its thatched roof and aesthetic structure, once housed the iconic
            Scottish missionary best known for stopping the killing of twins in
            Calabar. Rather than choose to dwell among her colleagues in the
            missionary quarters, Mary Mitchell Slessor opted to live among the
            Calabar people. The outcome of that brave decision is the Mary
            Slessor House in Ekenge, Calabar, which stands today as a testament
            to her selfless service and courage.

          <li><h1>Jaekel House, Lagos (image)</h1></li>
          <p>
            Jaekel House is one of the oldest buildings located within the
            Nigerian Railway Compound in Lagos, it was built in 1900 and is
            regarded as a fine example of colonial-style tropical architecture.
            In a dilapidated state for years, the restoration of the building
            and extensive garden was completed in 2010 with an upper-floor Mini
            Museum. The place is now functioning as a railway museum.

          <li>
            <h1>First European storey building in Nigeria, Badagry (image)</h1>
          </li>
          <p>
            The foundation of this building was laid in 1842 while the house was
            completed in 1845. The one-storey building has a corrugated iron
            sheet roof overlooking the marina waterfront. It is the most popular
            mission house in Badagry because the first sets of missionaries in
            Nigeria settled at the building. The house has six large rooms, four
            stores, two large sitting rooms, and a safe where precious items are
            kept. <br /><br />
            History also has it that it was a place where returnee slaves
            lodged, one of which was Samuel Ajayi Crowther. This edifice was
            built by Reverend Henry Townsend of the Anglican Church Mission
            Society (CMS).

          <li><h1>Ancient Kano city walls (image)</h1></li>
          <p>
            The city walls of ancient Kano served solely as a defensive
            structure to protect the inhabitants of the city against sieges and
            external attacks. Sakri Gijimasu, the 3rd Emir of Kano laid its
            foundations in the 11th century (1095 AD), while the walls are
            recorded to have been completed sometime in the middle of the 14th
            century. To this day, this wall still attracts tourists from across
            the globe.

          <li><h1>National War Museum, Abia (image)</h1></li>
          <p>
            Built in 1985, this structure is significant for housing weapons
            that were used in one of Nigeria’s most defining moments. It has
            three galleries that cover traditional warfare, the armed forces,
            and the Nigerian Civil War weapon galleries. The museum has a
            collection of objects from traditional and modern warfare. There are
            also outdoor displays of warships, military aircraft, armored tanks,
            and “Ogbunigwe” (bombs produced locally by Biafra during the
            Nigerian Civil War). <br /><br />

            Architectural designs are some of the attractions that draw tourists
            into a country, and one peculiar thing about them is that they speak
            about the time they were built. There are obviously more than five
            historical buildings in Nigeria that hold significant cultural and
            national values, however, the five highlighted in this article have
            over the years proven to represent the very values that we stand for
            as a people and a nation. While they continue to need improvement
            from the government and private sectors, they still manage to draw a
            fair tourist attraction from within and outside Nigeria.
